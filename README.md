# Minecraft-Gamemodes-Maps-and-Game-Information
This GitHub repository will act as the central hub for accessing gamemode repositories, map downloads, and game information.

Will be posted to servers soon!

# Rules and Information for adding maps
Please have the map that you are adding fully updated and fully converted. If you need any help with converting maps and updating them, please reach out to me and I will help you. If you aren't able to upload a map to the GitHub, please let me know, and I will help you out. If you send me a map to add, I will give you credit for it being added unless told otherwise. Please don't upload maps that have already been uploaded unless it is an updated version.

Here is the video for adding maps to the GitHub:
